# Briar User Manual #

## What is Briar? ##

Briar is a messaging app designed for activists, journalists, and anyone else who needs a safe, easy and robust way to communicate. Unlike traditional messaging tools such as email, Twitter or Telegram, Briar doesn't rely on a central server - messages are synchronized directly between the users' devices. If the Internet's down, Briar can sync via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, keeping the information flowing in a crisis. If the Internet's up, Briar can sync via the Tor network, protecting users and their relationships from surveillance.

## Installation ##

Briar is [available on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.briarproject.briar.beta) for devices running Android.

> **Tip:** If you're not sure whether you have an Android device, check whether it has the Play Store app. If it does, it runs Android.

If you have an Android device but you prefer not to use Google Play, you can install Briar by following these steps:

1. Open the Settings app, scroll down, and open the Security section.
2. Enable "Unknown sources" and confirm that you want to change the setting.
3. Open the web browser and go to https://briarproject.org/beta/briar.apk
4. Confirm that you want to download the file.
5. When the download completes, tap the notification to install Briar.
6. Go back to the Settings app and disable "Unknown sources".

## Creating an Account ##

The first time you open Briar you'll be asked to create an account. You can choose any nickname and password. The password should be at least 8 characters long and hard to guess.

> **Warning:** Your Briar account is stored securely on your device, not in the cloud. If you uninstall Briar or forget your password, there's no way to recover your account.

Tap "Create Account". When your account has been created you'll be taken to the contact list.

## Adding Contacts ##

To add a contact, tap the plus icon at the top of the contact list.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

<img src="assets/img/add-contact-1.png" alt="Adding a contact, step 1">

You must meet up with the person you want to add as a contact. Each of you will scan a QR code from the other person's screen. This ensures you're connecting to the right person, so nobody else can impersonate you or read your messages.

Tap "Continue" when you're ready to start.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

<img src="assets/img/add-contact-2.png" alt="Adding a contact, step 2">

Line up your contact's QR code in the viewfinder. You may have to wait a few seconds for the camera to focus.

When the camera has scanned the QR code you'll see the message "Waiting for contact to scan and connect". Now your contact should scan your QR code.

<div style="clear:both"></div>
